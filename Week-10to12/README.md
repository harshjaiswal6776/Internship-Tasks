## Week 10–12 – Vulnerability Assessment & Security Reconnaissance

### Overview
This phase of the internship focused on performing a **structured vulnerability
assessment and reconnaissance** on a practice target in a **controlled and
authorized learning environment**.

The objective was to understand **how security assessments are conducted**
without exploiting or damaging systems.

### Scope of Work
- Target identification (sanitized for security)
- Passive and active reconnaissance
- Vulnerability identification (non-exploitative)
- Security misconfiguration analysis
- Documentation and reporting
